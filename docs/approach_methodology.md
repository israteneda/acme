First I started with the set up of the environment, creating the repository, docs, adding the Readme and configuring the GitHub actions.

Secondly I started thinking how structure the console app, so I search for some examples on GitHub, after that I create the app structure and architecture using C4 Model.

To start with the functional side I decided to develop a minimum viable implementation to refactor later. I implemented the basic functionality with the provided use cases.

Later I improve the basic functionality to allow working hours in multiple work shifts, finally I validated the format of the input file.

After developed the solution, I deploy the console app to PyPI to easily use for the end user.

For the app development I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)" target="_blank">Kanban Method</a> with [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/israteneda/acme/projects/1)

Finally for time managment I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a>.
